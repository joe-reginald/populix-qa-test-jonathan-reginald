Hello! My name is Joe and this is my first Selenium project for Populix Technical Test. 

Setup requirements:
1. Python 3 
    - (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Selenium
    - After Python has been installed, go to command prompt (cmd)
    - Type 'pip install selenium'
3. Code Editor(VSCode/Pycharm)
    - Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - Pycharm Community Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
4. Chrome Browser
    - Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
5. Chrome Webdriver
    - Check your version of Chrome in Settings -> About Chrome
    - Download the corresponding webdriver version in through https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads


Test Cases :
1. Normal login (Email & Password registered & matched)
2. Facebook login
3. Google login
4. Go to register page
5. Go to playstore page
6. Go to appstore page
7. Login with invalid email
8. Login with invalid password

Issues :
1. Register page
    - Got an error that says USB: usb_device_handle_win.cc:1020 Failed to read descriptor from node connection: A device attached to the system is not functioning. (0x1F)
    - I can't seem to select textboxes(first name, last name)

2. Facebook & Google login
    - I can't continue doing login using my personal google and facebook account (I can't just type my credentials in the code, there should be a way but I haven't found it). So I stopped the test case until I got redirected to their website.

Thank you Populix for the opportunity. I will continue learning Python and selenium!
